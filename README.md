# Deploy Python Scripts via GIT

Maybe this is just useful for me: I'd like to use git for deployment of python
scripts to Windows machines. With the following caveats

* those Windows machines already have a full installation of python
* it might be necessary to make and track minor changes right away
* I'd like not to expose the detailed time of every commit 

Usage:

```commandline
python deploypywinviagit.py ../application/desktop-entries.ini
```

## Configuration files

All information are read from ini files, like

```ini
[DesktopEntry-1]
script=bin/application.py
name=application
icon=icons/application.ico

[DesktiopEntry-2]
module=bin.other_application
name=other application
icon=icons/other-application.ico

[Documentation]
glob=app/documentation/*.rst
desktop-entry=Application Help

[Repository]
src=git-helper@development-machine.local:src/application
dst=$HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH/application
version=app/__init__.py
```

## SSH identity files

If a file `ssh-identity` exists besides `deploywinviagit.py` this file is
offered to `ssh-agent`.  This file is the private key generated by `ssh-keygen`


## Git Config

If git-helper just points to a directory owned by somebody else, you have to
exectute (as git-helper):

```
git config --add safe.directory $HOME/src/application
```
